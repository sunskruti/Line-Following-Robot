# Line-Following Robot Development

## 🤖 Overview
An autonomous robot designed to follow a black line path using infrared sensors and feedback control algorithms. A great introduction to embedded systems and control logic.

## 🧠 Highlights
- Used infrared sensors for line detection
- PID control for smooth path-following
- C++ and Arduino for logic implementation
- Compact, wired chassis with motor drivers

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Arduino
- C++
- PID Control
- Infrared Sensors
- Motor Drivers (L298N)

## 📁 Folder Structure
- `/code` – Arduino code
- `/circuit_diagrams` – Sensor and wiring diagrams
- `/images` – Robot photos and path test
